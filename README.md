# week1-challange

## Description
Completed Week 1's code refractoring challenge. Went through the html and added semantic elements to make sure that it was properly structured. Then went through the CSS and consolidated redundant classes.

## Credits
Used the content from the UW edx full stack bootcamp as well as this information about proper semantic html. https://www.semrush.com/blog/semantic-html5-guide/
